WATCH OUT: This is work in progress

**This is my personal learning material and is therefore neither a scientific peer reviewed article nor an authoritative textbook.**

With this book I want to apply my statistical knowledge using the R language to investigate social inequality for Austria, my country of birth and where I am living.

As an `r glossary("advanced organizer")` I will take "A Brief History of Euqality" by Thomas Piketty [@piketty2022].

I am writing this book as a text for others to read because that forces me to become explicit and explain all my learning outcomes more carefully.

Please keep in mind that this text is not written by an expert but by a learner.

## Content {.unnumbered}


My text and data evaluation tries to follow the material in the book by Thomas Piketty, mentioned above. But I will try to demonstrate his argumentation with data for Austria. Additionally I am planing to compare this data with other countries of my interest, especially Germany.


## Glossary {.unnumbered}


I am using the {**glossary**} package to create links to glossary
entries.\]

::: my-r-code
::: my-r-code-header
::: {#cnj-load-glossary}
: Load glossary
:::
:::

::: my-r-code-container


```{r}
#| label: load-glossary
#| lst-label: lst-preface-load-glossary
#| lst-cap: "Install and load the glossary package with the appropriate glossary.yml file"


## 1. Install the glossary package:
## https://debruine.github.io/glossary/

library(glossary)

## If you want to use my glossary.yml file:

## 1. fork my repo
##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb

## 2. Download the `glossary.yml` file from
##    https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml)

## 3. Store the file on your hard disk
##    and change the following path accordingly

glossary::glossary_path("../glossary-pb/glossary.yml")

```

If you hover with your mouse over the double underlined links it opens
an window with the appropriate glossary text. Try this example: `r glossary("Z-Score")`.

WATCH OUT! There is no guarantee that the glossary text -- as well as the whole book -- contains correct information. Whenever possible I have mentioned the source of the glossary entry. (You will find an active linke to the source in the original glossary file at [GitHub](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml))

I have added many of the glossary entries when I was working through
other books either taking the text passage of these books I was reading
or via an internet recherche from other resources. I have added the
source of glossary entry. Sometimes I have used abbreviation, but I need
still to provide a key what this short references mean.
:::

To apply the glossary into this text I have used the {**glossary**} package by [Lisa DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io/glossary/index.html).

:::

If you fork the [repository of this quarto
book](https://github.com/petzi53/inequality-austria) then the glossary will not
work out of the box. Load down the `glossary.yml` file from [my
glossary-pb GitHub
repo](https://github.com/petzi53/glossary-pb/blob/master/glossary.yml),
store it on your hard disk and change the path in the code chunk
@lst-preface-load-glossary.

In any case I am the only responsible person for this text.

## R Code {.unnumbered}


For R code I am using mainly the [Tidyverse Style
Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) with some additions from [Googleâ€™s R Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html). These additons are:

-   Start the names of private functions with a dot.
-   Don't use `base::attach()`.
-   No right-hand assignments.
-   Qualify namespace. 

Especially the last point (qualifying namespace) is important for my
learning. Besides preventing conflicts with functions of identical names
from different packages it helps me to learn (or remember) which function
belongs to which package. I think this justifies the small overhead and
helps to make R code chunks self-sufficient. (No previous package
loading, or library calls in the setup chunk.) To foster learning the
relation between function and package I embrace the package name with
curly brakes and format it in bold. Additionally I will add a special annex file "Used packages" with an alphabetically sorted list of short package descriptions.


I am mentioning package name explicitly also for the default installation of base R. This wouldn't be necessary but it helps me to understand where the base R functions come from. What follows is a list of base R packages of the system library included into every installation and attached (opened) by
default:

-   {**base**}: The R Base Package
-   {**datsets**}: The R Datasets Package
-   {**graphics**}: The R Graphics Package
-   {**grDevices**}: The R Graphics Devices and Support for Colours and Fonts
-   {**methods**}: Formal Methods and Classes
-   {**stats**}: The R Stats Package
-   {**utils**}: The R Utils Package
 
 But I will not always mention the name of the argument inside a function. When it is clear then I will follow the advice from Hadley Wickham:
> When you call a function, you typically omit the names of data
> arguments, because they are used so commonly. If you override the
> default value of an argument, use the full name ([tidyverse style
> guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)).

## Data {.unnumbered}


Piketty refers for all the data to the [World Inequality Database](https://wid.world/). I will also take most of my data from this website.
