But he is not affiliated anymore with\nthe WID and has recently (2024-08-24) withdrawn all support for these\ntools.\n\nFor the R and STATA code he claims grave concerns regarding the validity\nand integrity of the data these packages accesses. In the case of\n`gpinter` he points out:\n\n> Experience has shown that the approach the package implements causes\n> more problems than it solves, especially when used by people who do\n> not understand the underlying methodology and treat it as a black box.\n> Older approaches, such as the mean-split histogram (see e.g.,\n> Measuring Inequality, Appendix A7, p. 172 [@cowell2011]), provide\n> nearly identical results at a fraction of the cost and complexity (and\n> to the extent that the results diverge, it almost certainly indicates\n> a problem with the raw data that should rather be addressed directly.)\n:::\n\n### Other WIL projects\n\nThe <a class='glossary' title='The ‘World Inequality Database’ (WID) aims to provide open and convenient access to the most extensive available database on the historical evolution of the world distribution of income and wealth, both within countries and between countries.

The article is\n    written in Spanish and it is based on [More Unequal or Not as Rich?\n    Revisiting the Latin American\n    Exception](https://wid.world/document/more-unequal-or-not-as-rich-revisiting-the-latin-american-exception-world-inequality-lab-working-paper-2022-13/).\n    The article examines income distribution in Latin America and\n    challenges the commonly accepted belief that the region is an\n    exception to global trends of growing inequality. To support his\n    research the team built new datasets which covers 80% of the\n    region's population and combines surveys harmonized, social security\n    data, tax returns on national income and accounts during the period\n    2000-2020.\n-   [Global Taxation of Capital and\n    Labor](https://globaltaxation.world/) studies how the globalization\n    has affected the taxation of labor and capital incomes. To address\n    this questions the authors built and analyzed a new, global database\n    on effective macroeconomic tax rates in more than 150 countries\n    since 1965, combining national accounts data with government revenue\n    statistics, including from a wide variety of archival records.\n-   [Realtime Inequality](https://realtimeinequality.org/) provides the\n    first timely statistics on how economic growth is distributed across\n    groups. When new growth numbers come out each quarter, we show how\n    each income and wealth group benefits to conclude who benefits from\n    income and wealth Growth in the United States.\n-   [Carbon Inequality\n    Data](https://wid.world/news-article/climate-change-the-global-inequality-of-carbon-emissions/)\n    explores the inequality of carbon footprint across the global\n    population. Lucas Chancel estimates the global inequality of\n    individual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions between 1990 and 2019\n    using a newly assembled dataset of income and wealth inequality,\n    environmental input-output tables and a framework differentiating\n    emissions from consumption and investments [@chancel2022c;\n    @chancel2022d].\n-   [Inequality Transparency Index](https://wid.world/transparency)\n    reports about the extent of inequality data opacity per country. The\n    index inequality transparency index ranges from 0 to 20 for each\n    country. The index looks at four different data sources: income\n    surveys, income tax data, wealth surveys and wealth tax data and\n    different components for each of these sources: Quality, Frequency\n    of Publication and Access to Data.It explains the calculation in a\n    [Technical\n    Note](https://wid.world/document/inequality-transparency-index-update-world-inequality-lab-technical-note-2020-12/)\n    and provides [data for each\n    country](https://wid.world/document/inequality-transparency-index-update-raw-data-2023/).\n-   [Missing Profits](https://missingprofits.world/) investigates how\n    much profits each country loses or attracts because of tax\n    avoidance.

You can visualize\n    how much each income group pays in taxes when we include all taxes\n    (income taxes, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, consumption taxes,\n    etc.) at all levels of government (federal, state, and local). Plus\n    you can explore how changing existing taxes—such as increasing\n    individual income tax rates—or creating new taxes—such as a\n    progressive wealth tax or a value added tax—would affect tax\n    revenue, tax progressivity, and inequality. There is a [Technical\n    Appendix](https://www.taxjusticenow.org/appendix) with all the\n    programs and data for replication.\n:::\n:::\n\n## Other data resources\n\nThe WID will be my my starting point for exploring the inequality in\nAustria. But whenever sensible I will try to discover and use other\nresources as well. What follows is a list of possible data resources I\nhave already found. With the exception of OWID and SWIID those data are recommended in WIR2022 as additional data resources for inequality research [@chancel2022a].\n\n::: my-resource\n::: my-resource-header\n::: {#lem-inequality-data}\n: A short list of inequality data resources besides the WID (arranged\nalphabetically)\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-resource-container\n-   **CEQ**: The [Commitment to Equity\n    Database](https://commitmentoequity.org/) (CEQ) was founded by [Nora\n    Lustig](https://noralustig.tulane.edu/) of the Tulane University and\n    is managed by an institute with the same name. The Institute works\n    to reduce inequality and poverty through comprehensive and rigorous\n    tax and benefit incidence analysis, and active engagement with the\n    policy community. Its objective is to measure the impact of fiscal\n    policy on inequality and poverty across the world using a comparable\n    framework [@lustig2022; @lustig2022a].\n-   **EU-SILC**: The [European Survey of Income and Living\n    Conditions](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/income-and-living-conditions)\n    (EU-SILC) database is a comprehensive statistical instrument that\n    collects and provides multidimensional microdata on income, poverty,\n    social exclusion, and living conditions in the European Union (EU).\n    The database is designed to support policymakers, researchers, and\n    analysts in monitoring and evaluating social policies, as well as\n    conducting evidence-based research on various aspects of income,\n    poverty, and well-being in Europe.\n-   **IDD & WDD**: [OECD Income and wealth distribution\n    databases](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/income-and-wealth-distribution-database.html)\n    are two dedicated statistical databases to benchmark and monitor\n    economic inequality across countries: The OECD Income Distribution\n    Database (IDD) offers data on levels and trends in income inequality\n    and poverty and is updated on a rolling basis, two to three times a\n    year. The OECD Wealth Distribution Database (WDD) collects\n    information on the distribution of household net wealth and is\n    updated every two or three years.\n-   **LIS**: The [Luxembourg Income Study\n    Database](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/) (LIS) is a data archive\n    and research center dedicated to cross-national analysis.

PIP provides a comprehensive view of global,\n    regional, and country-level trends for more than 160 economies\n    around the world [@worldbank2024].\n-   **SEDLAC**: The [Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the\n    Caribbean](https://www.cedlas.econo.unlp.edu.ar/wp/en/estadisticas/sedlac/estadisticas/)\n    (SEDLAC) includes statistics on poverty and other distributional and\n    social variables from 25 Latin American and Caribbean (LAC)\n    countries. All statistics are computed from microdata of the main\n    household surveys carried out in these countries using a homogeneous\n    methodology (data permitting). SEDLAC allows users to monitor the\n    trends in poverty and other distributional and social indicators in\n    the region. The database is available in the form of brief reports,\n    charts and electronic Excel tables with information for each\n    country/year. In addition, the website visitor can carry out dynamic\n    searches online.\n-   **SWIID**: The goal of the [Standardized World Income Inequality\n    Database](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LM4OWF)\n    (SWIID) is to meet the needs of those engaged in broadly\n    cross-national research by maximizing the comparability of income\n    inequality data while maintaining the widest possible coverage\n    across countries and over time. The SWIID standardizes the United\n    Nations University database (UNU-WIDER 2008)[^01-data-resources-1].\n    The SWIID’s income inequality estimates are based on thousands of\n    reported <a class='glossary' title='The Gini index is a widely used statistical measure to quantify the extent of income or wealth inequality within a population. It ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%), with higher values indicating greater inequality. The Gini coefficient is calculated based on the Lorenz curve, which plots the population proportion against the income or wealth share. It was developed by Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini. (misc.)'>Gini indices</a> from hundreds of\n    published sources. The SWIID currently incorporates comparable Gini\n    indices of disposable and market income inequality for 199 countries\n    for as many years as possible from 1960 to the present (version 9.6,\n    December 2023); it also includes information on absolute and\n    relative redistribution.

It is managed by a\n    small research group concerned with measuring and explaining\n    movements of inequality in wages and earnings and patterns of\n    industrial change around the world. Their work has emphasized the\n    use of <a class='glossary' title='The Theil index is a statistic used to measure economic inequality.

The latest version of the\n    WIID, released 28 November 2023, covers 201 countries (including\n    historical entities) through 2022, with over 24,000 data points in\n    total. There are now nearly 4,000 unique country-year observations\n    in the database. The WIID is managed by [UNU\n    WIDER](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/organisation/unu-wider-united-nations-university-world-institute-development-economics-research_en) -\n    the United Nations University World Institute for Development\n    Economics Research.\n:::\n:::\n\n[^01-data-resources-1]: But the WIID in is latest version is also\n    already standardized. See\n    [WIID](https://www.wider.unu.edu/database/world-income-inequality-database-wiid). Additionally there are concerns about the data imputation model at least for SWIID version 4.0 [@jenkins2015]. \n\nTo understand use all these data resources is a complex enterprise. As a\nfirst step and starting point I will concentrate on the World Inequality\nDatabase (WID) because there exist several monographs where these data\nare used and interpreted. But most of the time these books refer to\nglobal, regional or 'important' countries like China, France, German,\nIndia, United Kingdom, United States etc. My challenge is trying to\nreplicate the main results with the example of Austria. Unfortunately\nthe dataset for Austria is not very comprehensive. It could be the case\nthat I should try to develop my own dataset for Austria using specific\ndata sources like [Statistic Austria](https://www.statistik.at/en/) or\nthe European Survey on Income and Living Conditions\n(<a class='glossary' title='European Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is a survey on living conditions in the European Union.
