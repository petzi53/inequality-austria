At the moment of this writing (August 2024) I do not know what data exactly I am going to use for my research. Therefore I will update this chapter continuously.\n\n\n:::\n::::\n:::::\n\n## Data resources \n\n### World Inequality Lab (WIL)\n\nThe WIL consists of a [team of about 40 people](https://inequalitylab.world/en/team/), based primarily at the Paris School of Economics and the University of Berkeley, California. It is supported by more than 200 researchers of diverse nationalities and institutions, forming the so-called [WID Fellows](https://inequalitylab.world/en/%20wid-fellows/). (See the [complete team](https://wid.world/team/) working on the WID.)\n\n#### World Inequality Database (WID)\n\nGenerally I will prefer data already collected and cleaned by some trustful organizations or researchers. And from these I will preferable (or at least start) with data free accessible at the <a class='glossary' title='The ‘World Inequality Database’ (WID) aims to provide open and convenient access to the most extensive available database on the historical evolution of the world distribution of income and wealth, both within countries and between countries. WID.WORLD'>WID</a>. These data are compiled by the <a class='glossary' title='The ’World Inequality Lab (WIL) is a global research center focused on the study of inequality and public policies that promote social, economic and environmental justice. (WIL)'>WIL</a> and presented as open-access datasets accompanied by publications, graphics, tables slides and an interactive website at https://wid.world.\n\n:::::{.my-resource}\n:::{.my-resource-header}\n:::::: {#lem-wid}\n: Structure of the WID Resources\n::::::\n:::\n::::{.my-resource-container}\n\n### Interactive website {.unnumbered}\n\n- **World View**: Compare inequality between country on an interactive world map.\n- **Country Graphs**: Follow the evolution of inequality within countries with user-friendly graphs.\n- **Data Tables**: Download the <a class='glossary' title='Open-access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions. OA removes price barriers (subscriptions, licensing fees, pay-per-view fees) and permission barriers (most copyright and licensing restrictions). The PLoS shorthand definition — ‘free availability and unrestricted use’ — succinctly captures both elements.

For internationally comparable national accounts this system needs to be based on common concepts, definitions, classifications and accounting rules, in order to arrive at a consistent, reliable and comparable quantitative description of an economy. National accounts provide systematic and detailed economic data useful for economic analysis to support the development and monitoring of policy-making. eurostat - Statistics explained.'>National Accounts</a> and the estimation of inequality series for income and wealth. It explains methods and concepts used in the World Inequality Database.

But there are additionally many projects with additional datasets. \n\nWhat follows are lists of possible data resources. \n\nAs an <a class='glossary' title='Advance organizers are pedagogic devices that bridge the gap between what learners already know and what learners need to know. (Encyclopedia of the Science of Learning)'>advanced organizer</a> I will take \"A Brief History of\nEquality\" by Thomas Piketty [@piketty2022]. \n\nMy text and data evaluation tries to follow the material in the book by\nThomas Piketty, mentioned above. But I will try to demonstrate his\nargumentation with data for Austria. Additionally I am planing to\ncompare this data with other countries of my interest, especially\nGermany.\n\nPiketty refers for all the data to the [World Inequality\nDatabase](https://wid.world/). But recently I have noted, that there are\nother important data resources on inequality as well:\n\n::: my-resource\n::: my-resource-header\n::: {#lem-inequality-data}\n: A short list of inequality data resources\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-resource-container\n-   **WID**: The [World Inequality\n    Database](https://wid.world/wid-world/) (WID) aims to provide open\n    and convenient access to the most extensive available database on\n    the historical evolution of the world distribution of income and\n    wealth, both within countries and between countries\n    [@worldinequalitylab2024].\n-   **OWID**: [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) (OWID) is\n    an online publication that focuses on large global problems such as\n    poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks,\n    and inequality [@globalchangedatalab2024].\n-   **PIP**: The [Poverty and Inequality\n    Platform](https://pip.worldbank.org/home) (PIP) is an interactive\n    computational tool that offers users quick access to the World\n    Bank’s estimates of poverty, inequality, and shared prosperity.

As a\nfirst step and starting point I will concentrate on the World Inequality\nDatabase because there exist several monographs where these data are\nused and interpreted. But most of the time these books refer to global,\nregional or 'important' countries like China, France, German, India,\nUnited Kingdom, United States etc.\n\nThe <a class='glossary' title='The ’World Inequality Lab (WIL) is a global research center focused on the study of inequality and public policies that promote social, economic and environmental justice.

It endeavours first to shed light on these various dimensions of climate inequality in a systematic and detailed analysis, focusing on low- and middle-income countries in particular. It then builds on these insights, together with additional empirical work and interviews with experts, to suggest pathways to development cooperation, and tax and social policies that tackle climate inequalities at their core.
