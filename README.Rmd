<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This Quarto book looks into different aspects of inequality in my native country Austria. I am going to explore data from the [World Inequality Database](https://wid.world/) (WID) and from the [World Happiness Reports](https://worldhappiness.report/analysis/) (WHR).

This is work in progressâ€¦
