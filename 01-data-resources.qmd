Objective of this chapter

::: {.my-objectives-container}

This short chapter will list possible data resources. At the moment of this writing (August 2024) I do not know what data exactly I am going to use for my research. Therefore I will update this chapter continuously.

## Data resources 

### World Inequality Lab (WIL)

The WIL consists of a [team of about 40 people](https://inequalitylab.world/en/team/), based primarily at the Paris School of Economics and the University of Berkeley, California. It is supported by more than 200 researchers of diverse nationalities and institutions, forming the so-called [WID Fellows](https://inequalitylab.world/en/%20wid-fellows/). (See the [complete team](https://wid.world/team/) working on the WID.)

#### World Inequality Database (WID)

Generally I will prefer data already collected and cleaned by some trustful organizations or researchers. And from these I will preferable (or at least start) with data free accessible at the `r glossary("WID")`. These data are compiled by the `r glossary("WIL")` and presented as open-access datasets accompanied by publications, graphics, tables slides and an interactive website at https://wid.world.

### Interactive website {.unnumbered}

- **World View**: Compare inequality between country on an interactive world map.
- **Country Graphs**: Follow the evolution of inequality within countries with user-friendly graphs.
- **Data Tables**: Download the `r glossary("open-access")` datasets from the [data page](https://wid.world/data/. You can prepare selected data to download or download the complete dataset.

### Methodology {.unnumbered}

- **Distributional National Account (DINA) Guidelines**: `r glossary("DINA")` is a resource to understand the methodology behind the decomposition of `r glossary("National Accounts")` and the estimation of inequality series for income and wealth. It explains methods and concepts used in the World Inequality Database. The version I am using is from February 2024, has 186 pages, and can be [downloaded as PDF](https://wid.world/document/distributional-national-accounts-guidelines-2020-concepts-and-methods-used-in-the-world-inequality-database/).

The WID is the main resource I am going to use. But there are additionally many projects with additional datasets. 

What follows are lists of possible data resources. 

As an `r glossary("advanced organizer")` I will take "A Brief History of
Equality" by Thomas Piketty [@piketty2022]. 

My text and data evaluation tries to follow the material in the book by
Thomas Piketty, mentioned above. But I will try to demonstrate his
argumentation with data for Austria. Additionally I am planing to
compare this data with other countries of my interest, especially
Germany.

Piketty refers for all the data to the [World Inequality
Database](https://wid.world/). But recently I have noted, that there are
other important data resources on inequality as well:

-   **WID**: The [World Inequality
    Database](https://wid.world/wid-world/) (WID) aims to provide open
    and convenient access to the most extensive available database on
    the historical evolution of the world distribution of income and
    wealth, both within countries and between countries
    [@worldinequalitylab2024].
-   **OWID**: [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) (OWID) is
    an online publication that focuses on large global problems such as
    poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks,
    and inequality [@globalchangedatalab2024].
-   **PIP**: The [Poverty and Inequality
    Platform](https://pip.worldbank.org/home) (PIP) is an interactive
    computational tool that offers users quick access to the World
    Bankâ€™s estimates of poverty, inequality, and shared prosperity. PIP
    provides a comprehensive view of global, regional, and country-level
    trends for more than 160 economies around the world
    [@worldbank2024].
-   **LIS**: The [Luxembourg Income Study
    Database](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/) (LIS) is a data archive
    and research center dedicated to cross-national analysis. It is home
    to the [Luxembourg Income Study
    Database](http://www.lisdatacenter.org/our-data/lis-database/) (LIS)
    and the [Luxembourg Wealth Study
    Database](http://www.lisdatacenter.org/our-data/lws-database/) (LWS)
    [@lisauthorcollective2024].

To understand use all these data resources is a complex enterprise. As a
first step and starting point I will concentrate on the World Inequality
Database because there exist several monographs where these data are
used and interpreted. But most of the time these books refer to global,
regional or 'important' countries like China, France, German, India,
United Kingdom, United States etc.

The `r glossary("WIL")` is working on several important research projects, most of them have not only publication but also free and open accessible data sets. All of these projects can function as `r glossary("advanced organizer", "advanced organizers")` for me. I have to inspect their data sets and figure out what would be an effective learning approach.

-   **WIPD**: The [World Political Cleavages and Inequality
    Database](https://wpid.world/) (WPID) is the result of a collaborative research program involving about twenty researchers all around the world. The central aim is to provide open and convenient access to the most extensive available dataset on the structure of political cleavages and social inequalities in electoral democracies, located on the five continents, from the mid-20th century to the present. [@gethin2024].
-   Une histoire du conflit politique: Elections and social inequalities in France, 1789-2022 [@cage2023].
-   [Climate Inequality Report 2023](https://wid.world/news-article/climate-inequality-report-2023-fair-taxes-for-a-sustainable-future-in-the-global-south/): The aim of this report is twofold. It endeavours first to shed light on these various dimensions of climate inequality in a systematic and detailed analysis, focusing on low- and middle-income countries in particular. It then builds on these insights, together with additional empirical work and interviews with experts, to suggest pathways to development cooperation, and tax and social policies that tackle climate inequalities at their core. (This project has at the moment not public data available.)
-   **WIR2022**: [The World Inequality Report
    2022](https://wir2022.wid.world/methodology/) (WIR2022)

I will try to follow the arguments of two books that I will use as
`r glossary("advanced organizer", "advanced organizers")` to illustrate
their discussion with data from Austria: These books are "A Brief
History of Equality" (BHE) [@piketty2022] and the "World Inequality
Report 2022" (WIR2022) [@chancel2022].
